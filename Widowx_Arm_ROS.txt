// This file is tutorial to makes widowx arm ready to work with ROS


// Step 1: Check port number on which arm is connected

// Usually it will be connecting to port ttyUSB0 or ttyACM0

// To check that connect USB to your computer and open new terminal
$ ls /dev/tty*



//  Disconnect the USB and run the command again to check that port number
// disappears

$ ls /dev/tty*


// Step 2: Make widowx arm ready to work with ROS

// I will follow this tutorial with some modifications
// https://github.com/RobotnikAutomation/widowx_arm/blob/master/README.md

1- Download Ardunio ide:
$ wget https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-1.0.6-linux64.tgz
and extract it in Downloads/ardunio-10.6

2- Download the firmware archives
$ wget https://github.com/trossenrobotics/arbotix/archive/master.zip
Create a new folder inside "Documents" directory and call it "Ardunio"
and extract files into "~/Documents/Ardunio"

3- Run arduino from the folder you extracted it previously
$ cd ~/Downloads/arduino-1.0.6
$ ./arduino

4- Once Arduino IDE is running, change the Sketchbook folder location to
~/Documents/Arduino/arbotixmaster

File->Preferences->Sketchbook Location

5- Change Board to "Arbotix"

Tools->Board->Arbotix

6- Change port to "ttyUSB0"

Tools->Serial Port->/dev/ttyUSB0

7- Choose ros file to upload on Ardunio board of Arbotix Arm

File->Sketchbook->Arbotix Sketches ->ros
Verify + Upload


// Step 3: Check widowx arm works good and all motors' ID are setup

$ sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0
$ arbotix_terminal

then ls


// you should get 1 2 3 4 5 6 .. .. >> which means all the six servo motors are
 well-identified
